# Introduction

DISCLAIMER: This is very early a work-in-progress design and has not yet seen
significant (or really any) security analysis. It should not be used as a basis
for building production systems.

Although TLS 1.3 {{!RFC8446}} encrypts most of the handshake, including the
server certificate, there are several ways in which an on-path attacker can
learn private information about the connection. The plaintext Server Name
Indication (SNI) extension in ClientHello messages, which leaks the target
domain for a given connection, is perhaps the most sensitive information
unencrypted in TLS 1.3.

The target domain may also be visible through other channels, such as plaintext
client DNS queries, visible server IP addresses (assuming the server does not
use domain-based virtual hosting), or other indirect mechanisms such as traffic
analysis. DoH {{?RFC8484}} and DPRIVE {{?RFC7858}}
{{?RFC8094}} provide mechanisms for clients to conceal DNS lookups from network
inspection, and many TLS servers host multiple domains on the same IP address.
In such environments, the SNI remains the primary explicit signal used to
determine the server's identity.

The TLS Working Group has studied the problem of protecting the SNI, but has
been unable to develop a completely generic solution.
{{?RFC8744}} provides a description of the problem space and
some of the proposed techniques. One of the more difficult problems is "Do not
stick out" ({{?RFC8744}}, Section 3.4): if only sensitive or
private services use SNI encryption, then SNI encryption is a signal that a
client is going to such a service. For this reason, much recent work has focused
on concealing the fact that the SNI is being protected. Unfortunately, the
result often has undesirable performance consequences, incomplete coverage, or
both.

The protocol specified by this document takes a different approach. It assumes
that private origins will co-locate with or hide behind a provider (reverse
proxy, application server, etc.) that protects SNIs for all of the domains it
hosts. As a result, SNI protection does not indicate that the client is
attempting to reach a private origin, but only that it is going to a particular
service provider, which the observer could already tell from the visible IP
address.

This document specifies a new TLS extension, called Encrypted Client Hello
(ECH), that allows clients to encrypt their ClientHello to a supporting server.
This protects the SNI and other potentially sensitive fields, such as the ALPN
list {{?RFC7301}}. This extension is only supported with (D)TLS 1.3 {{!RFC8446}}
and newer versions of the protocol.

# Overview

This protocol is designed to operate in one of two topologies illustrated below,
which we call "Shared Mode" and "Split Mode".

## Topologies

{: #shared-mode title="Shared Mode Topology"}

In Shared Mode, the provider is the origin server for all the domains whose DNS
records point to it. In this mode, the TLS connection is terminated by the
provider.

            Client-Facing Server            Backend Server
~~~~
{: #split-mode title="Split Mode Topology"}

In Split Mode, the provider is not the origin server for private domains.
Rather, the DNS records for private domains point to the provider, and the
provider's server relays the connection back to the origin server, who
terminates the TLS connection with the client. Importantly, service provider
does not have access to the plaintext of the connection.

In the remainder of this document, we will refer to the ECH-service provider as
the "client-facing server" and to the TLS terminator as the "backend server".
These are the same entity in Shared Mode, but in Split Mode, the client-facing
and backend servers are physically separated.

## Encrypted ClientHello (ECH)

ECH allows the client to encrypt sensitive ClientHello extensions, e.g., SNI,
ALPN, etc., under the public key of the client-facing server. This requires the
client-facing server to publish the public key and metadata it uses for ECH for
all the domains for which it serves directly or indirectly (via Split Mode).
This document defines the format of the ECH encryption public key and metadata,
referred to as an ECH configuration, and delegates DNS publication details to
{{!HTTPS-RR=I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https}}, though other delivery mechanisms are
possible. In particular, if some of the clients of a private server are
applications rather than Web browsers, those applications might have the public
key and metadata preconfigured.

When a client wants to establish a TLS session with the backend server, it
constructs its ClientHello as usual (we will refer to this as the
ClientHelloInner message) and then encrypts this message using the ECH public
key. It then constructs a new ClientHello (ClientHelloOuter) with innocuous
values for sensitive extensions, e.g., SNI, ALPN, etc., and with the encrypted
ClientHelloInner in an "encrypted_client_hello" extension, which this document
defines ({{encrypted-client-hello}}). Finally, it sends ClientHelloOuter to the
server.

Upon receiving the ClientHelloOuter, the client-facing server takes one of the
following actions:

1. If it does not support ECH, it ignores the "encrypted_client_hello" extension
   and proceeds with the handshake as usual, per {{RFC8446}}, Section 4.1.2.
1. If it supports ECH but cannot decrypt it, then it ignores the extension and
   proceeds with the handshake as usual. This is referred to as "ECH rejection".
   When ECH is rejected, the server sends an acceptable ECH configuration in its
   EncryptedExtensions message.
1. If it supports ECH and can decrypt it, then it forwards the ClientHelloInner
   to the backend, who terminates the connection. This is referred to as "ECH
   acceptance".

Upon receiving the server's response, the client determines whether ECH was
accepted or rejected and proceeds with the handshake accordingly. (See
{{client-behavior}} for details.)

# Encrypted ClientHello Configuration {#ech-configuration}

ECH uses HPKE for public key encryption {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}. The ECH
configuration is defined by the following `ECHConfigs` structure.

~~~~
    opaque HpkePublicKey<1..2^16-1>;
    uint16 HpkeKemId;  // Defined in I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke
    uint16 HpkeKdfId;  // Defined in I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke
    uint16 HpkeAeadId; // Defined in I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke

    struct {
        HpkeKdfId kdf_id;
        HpkeAeadId aead_id;
    } HpkeCipherSuite;

    struct {
        opaque public_name<1..2^16-1>;

        HpkePublicKey public_key;
        HpkeKemId kem_id;
        HpkeCipherSuite cipher_suites<4..2^16-2>;

        uint16 maximum_name_length;
        Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
    } ECHConfigContents;

    struct {
        uint16 version;
        uint16 length;
        select (ECHConfig.version) {
          case 0xff07: ECHConfigContents;
        }
    } ECHConfig;

    ECHConfig ECHConfigs<1..2^16-1>;
~~~~

The `ECHConfigs` structure contains one or more `ECHConfig` structures in
decreasing order of preference. This allows a server to support multiple
versions of ECH and multiple sets of ECH parameters.

The `ECHConfig` structure contains the following fields:

version
: The version of ECH for which this configuration is used. The version of this
document SHALL be `0xff07`. (Future drafts and the final version MUST define a
version that has not already been assigned.) Clients MUST ignore any `ECHConfig`
structure with a version they do not support.

length
: The length, in bytes, of the next field.

contents
: An opaque byte string whose contents depend on the version of the structure.
For this specification, the contents are an `ECHConfigContents` structure.

The `ECHConfigContents` structure contains the following fields:

public_name
: The non-empty name of client-facing server, i.e., the entity trusted to update
these encryption keys. This is used to repair misconfigurations, as described in
{{handle-server-response}}.

public_key
: The HPKE public key used by the client to encrypt ClientHelloInner.

kem_id
: The HPKE KEM identifier corresponding to `public_key`. Clients MUST ignore any
`ECHConfig` structure with a key using a KEM they do not support.

cipher_suites
: The list of HPKE AEAD and KDF identifier pairs clients can use for encrypting
ClientHelloInner.

maximum_name_length
: The largest name the server expects to support, if known. If this value is
not known it can be set to zero, in which case clients SHOULD use the inner
ClientHello padding scheme described below. That could happen if wildcard names
are in use, or if names can be added or removed from the anonymity set during
the lifetime of a particular resource record value.

extensions
: A list of extensions that the client must take into consideration when
generating a ClientHello message. These are described below
({{config-extensions}}).

## Configuration Extensions {#config-extensions}

ECH configuration extensions are used to to provide room for additional
functionality as needed. See {{config-extensions-guidance}} for guidance on
which types of extensions are appropriate for this structure.

The format is as defined in {{RFC8446}}, Section 4.2.
The same interpretation rules apply: extensions MAY appear in any order, but
there MUST NOT be more than one extension of the same type in the extensions
block. An extension can be tagged as mandatory by using an extension type
codepoint with the high order bit set to 1. A client that receives a mandatory
extension they do not understand MUST reject the `ECHConfig` content.

Clients MUST parse the extension list and check for unsupported mandatory
extensions. If an unsupported mandatory extension is present, clients MUST
ignore the `ECHConfig`.

# The "encrypted_client_hello" extension {#encrypted-client-hello}

The encrypted ClientHelloInner is carried in an "encrypted_client_hello"
extension, defined as follows:

~~~
    enum {
       encrypted_client_hello(0xff02), (65535)
    } ExtensionType;
~~~

The extension request is carried by the ClientHelloOuter, i.e., the ClientHello
transmitted to the client-facing server. The payload contains the following
`ClientEncryptedCH` structure:

~~~~
    struct {
       HpkeCipherSuite cipher_suite;
       opaque config_id<0..255>;
       opaque enc<1..2^16-1>;
       opaque encrypted_ch<1..2^16-1>;
    } ClientEncryptedCH;
~~~~

cipher_suite
: The cipher suite used to encrypt ClientHelloInner. This MUST match a value
provided in the corresponding `ECHConfig.cipher_suites` list.

config_id
: The configuration identifier, equal to
`Expand(Extract("", config), "ech_config_id", Nh)`, where `config` is the
`ECHConfig` structure and `Extract`, `Expand`, and `Nh` are as specified by
the cipher suite KDF. (Passing the literal `""` as the salt is interpreted
by `Extract` as no salt being provided.) The length of this value SHOULD NOT
be less than 16 bytes unless it is optional for an application; see
{{optional-configs}}.

enc
: The HPKE encapsulated key, used by servers to decrypt the corresponding
`encrypted_ch` field.

encrypted_ch
: The serialized and encrypted ClientHelloInner structure, encrypted using HPKE
as described in {{send-ech}}.

When the client-facing server accepts ECH, it does not send this extension. When
it rejects, it adds an "encrypted_client_hello" extension to EncryptedExtensions
with the following structure as the payload:

~~~
    struct {
       ECHConfigs retry_configs;
    } ServerEncryptedCH;
~~~

retry_configs
: An ECHConfigs structure containing one or more ECHConfig structures, in
decreasing order of preference, to be used by the client in subsequent
connection attempts.

This document also defines the "ech_required" alert, which clients MUST send
when it offered an "encrypted_client_hello" extension that was not accepted by
the server. (See {{alerts}}.)

# The "ech_nonce" extension {#ech-nonce}

When using ECH, the client MUST include an extension of type "ech_nonce" to the
ClientHelloInner (but not to the ClientHelloOuter). This nonce is used to ensure
that the server's encrypted Certificate can only be read by the entity which
sent this ClientHello. This extension is defined as follows:

~~~
    enum {
       ech_nonce(0xff03), (65535)
    } ExtensionType;

    struct {
       uint8 nonce[16];
    } ECHNonce;
~~~~

nonce
: A 16-byte nonce exported from the HPKE encryption context, as described in
{{send-ech}}.

Per {{client-behavior}} and {{server-behavior}}, implementations are required to
track, alongside each PSK established by a previous connection, whether the
connection negotiated this extension with the "ech_accept" response type. If so,
this is referred to as an "ECH PSK". Otherwise, it is a "non-ECH PSK". This may
be implemented by adding a new field to client and server session states.

## Incorporating Outer Extensions {#outer-extensions}

When constructing the ClientHelloInner, it is often desirable for the client to
copy extensions from the ClientHelloOuter. (An example is the "key_share"
extension ({{RFC8446}}, 4.2.8), which the client would offer regardless of
whether the client-facing server or the backend server terminates the
connection.) This behavior is permissible, subject to specific restrictions
described in {{client-behavior}}.

This section specifies a mechanism for incorporating extensions from the
ClientHelloOuter into the ClientHelloInner without needing to a transmit a copy
of them. It defines two extension code points for this purpose:

~~~
    enum {
       outer_extension(0xff04),
       outer_extension_binder(0xff05), (65535)
    } ExtensionType;
~~~

These extensions differ from traditional ones in two important respects. First,
the client and server MUST NOT offer these extensions in any handshake message;
they will only ever appear in the ClientHelloInner. Second, there may be
multiple extensions of type "outer_extensions" in the ClientHelloInner.

The payload of an "outer_extension" is an ExtensionType. The payload of an
"outer_extension_binder" extension has the following structure:

~~~
    struct {
       opaque inner_digest<0..2^16-1>;
    } InnerDigest;
~~~

### Client Behavior {#outer-extensions-client-behavior}

Let `Extract`, `Expand`, and `Nh` be as defined by the API in
{{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}} for the KDF selected by the client as described in
{{client-behavior}}. After computing the ClientHelloInner, including any PSK
binders, The client MAY compress its ClientHelloInner with the following
procedure:

1. For each inner extension `ext`, if `ext.extension_type` is the type of some
   outer extension, then the client MAY replace `ext` with an extension of type
   "outer_extension" and with payload `ext.extension_type`.
1. If an extension was replaced in the previous step, then the client MUST
   append an extension of type "outer_extension_binder" to the inner extensions.
   The payload is set to `inner_digest = Expand(Extract("", inner),
   "ech_inner_digest", Nh)`, where `inner` is the uncompressed ClientHelloInner.

Compression only yields benefits for larger extensions. Therefore, it is
RECOMMENDED that clients only compress extensions whose payloads are larger than
2 bytes.

### Client-Facing Server Behavior {#outer-extensions-server-behavior}

Upon successful decryption of the ClientHelloInner, the client-facing server
MUST decompresses the structure with the following procedure:

1. For each inner extension `ext` of type "outer_extension", if there is an
   outer extension of type `ext.extension_data`, then replace `ext` with the
   outer extension. If no such extension exists, then the server MUST abort the
   handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.
1. If an extension was replaced in the previous step, then the server pops the
   last extension from the inner extensions. If the extension is not of type
   "outer_extension_binder" or its payload does not equal `Expand(Extract("",
   inner), "ech_inner_digest", Nh)`, then the server MUST abort with an
   "illegal_parameter" alert.

Validation of the `inner_digest` ensures that the decompressed ClientHelloInner
matches the value intended by the client. [[OPEN ISSUE: Is this not redundant?
The binding of the transcript hash to key derivation seems to provide the same
guarantee.]] Finally, the client-facing server forwards the decompressed
ClientHelloInner to the backend server.

# Client Behavior {#client-behavior}

## Sending an encrypted ClientHello {#send-ech}

In order to send an encrypted ClientHello, the client first determines if it
supports the server's chosen KEM, as identified by `ECHConfig.kem_id`. If one is
supported, the client MUST select an appropriate `HpkeCipherSuite` from the list
of suites offered by the server. If the client does not support the
corresponding KEM or is unable to select a suitable `HpkeCipherSuite`, it SHOULD
ignore that `ECHConfig` value and MAY attempt to use another value provided by
the server. The client MUST NOT send ECH using HPKE algorithms not advertised by
the server.

Given a compatible `ECHConfig` with fields `public_key` and `kem_id`, carrying
the `HpkePublicKey` and KEM identifier corresponding to the server, clients
compute an HPKE encryption context as follows:

~~~
    pkR = Deserialize(ECHConfig.public_key)
    enc, context = SetupBaseS(pkR, "tls13-ech")
    ech_nonce_value = context.Export("tls13-ech-nonce", 16)
    ech_hrr_key = context.Export("tls13-ech-hrr-key", 16)
~~~

Note that the HPKE functions Deserialize and SetupBaseS are those which match
`ECHConfig.kem_id` and the client's chosen preference from
`ECHConfig.cipher_suites`.

The client then generates a ClientHelloInner value. In addition to the normal
values, ClientHelloInner MUST also contain:

 - an "ech_nonce" extension, containing `ech_nonce_value` derived above
 - TLS padding {{!RFC7685}} (see {{padding}})

When offering an encrypted ClientHello, the client MUST NOT offer to resume any
non-ECH PSKs. It additionally MUST NOT offer to resume any sessions for TLS 1.2
or below.

The encrypted ClientHello value is then computed as:

~~~~
    encrypted_ch = context.Seal("", ClientHelloInner)
~~~~

Finally, the client MUST generate a ClientHelloOuter message containing the
"encrypted_client_hello" extension with the values as indicated above. In
particular,

- cipher_suite contains the client's chosen HpkeCipherSuite;
- config_id contains the identifier of the corresponding ECHConfig structure;
- enc contains the encapsulated key as output by SetupBaseS; and
- encrypted_ch contains the HPKE encapsulated key (enc) and the ClientHelloInner
  ciphertext (encrypted_ch_inner).

The client MUST place the value of `ECHConfig.public_name` in the
ClientHelloOuter "server_name" extension. See {{outer-clienthello}} for
additional discussion of ClientHelloOuter values.

## Recommended Padding Scheme {#padding}

This section describes a deterministic padding mechanism based on the following
observation: individual extensions can reveal sensitive information through
their length. Thus, each extension in the inner ClientHello may require
different amounts of padding. This padding may be fully determined by the
client's configuration or may require server input.

By way of example, clients typically support a small number of application
profiles. For instance, a browser might support HTTP with ALPN values
["http/1.1, "h2"] and WebRTC media with ALPNs ["webrtc", "c-webrtc"]. Clients
SHOULD pad this extension by rounding up to the total size of the longest ALPN
extension across all application profiles. The target padding length of most
ClientHello extensions can be computed in this way.

In contrast, clients do not know the longest SNI value in the client-facing
server's anonymity set without server input. For the "server_name" extension
with length D, clients SHOULD use the server's length hint L
(ECHCOnfig.maximum_name_length) when computing the padding as follows:

1. If L >= D, add L - D bytes of padding. This rounds to the server's
   advertised hint, i.e., ECHConfig.maximum_name_length.
2. Otherwise, let P = 31 - ((D - 1) % 32), and add P bytes of padding, plus an
   additional 32 bytes if D + P < L + 32. This rounds D up to the nearest
   multiple of 32 bytes that permits at least 32 bytes of length ambiguity.

In addition to padding ClientHelloInner, clients and servers will also need to
pad all other handshake messages that have sensitive-length fields. For example,
if a client proposes ALPN values in ClientHelloInner, the server-selected value
will be returned in an EncryptedExtension, so that handshake message also needs
to be padded using TLS record layer padding.

## Handling the server response {#handle-server-response}

As described in {{server-behavior}}, the server MAY either accept ECH and use
ClientHelloInner or reject it and use ClientHelloOuter. However, there is no
indication in ServerHello of which one the server has done and the client must
therefore use trial decryption in order to determine this.

### Accepted ECH

If the server used ClientHelloInner, the client proceeds with the connection as
usual, authenticating the connection for the origin server.

### Rejected ECH

If the server used ClientHelloOuter, the client proceeds with the handshake,
authenticating for ECHConfig.public_name as described in {{auth-public-name}}.
If authentication or the handshake fails, the client MUST return a failure to
the calling application. It MUST NOT use the retry keys.

Otherwise, when the handshake completes successfully with the public name
authenticated, the client MUST abort the connection with an "ech_required"
alert. It then processes the "retry_configs" field from the server's
"encrypted_client_hello" extension.

If one of the values contains a version supported by the client, it can regard
the ECH keys as securely replaced by the server. It SHOULD retry the handshake
with a new transport connection, using that value to encrypt the ClientHello.
The value may only be applied to the retry connection. The client MUST continue
to use the previously-advertised keys for subsequent connections. This avoids
introducing pinning concerns or a tracking vector, should a malicious server
present client-specific retry keys to identify clients.

If none of the values provided in "retry_configs" contains a supported version,
the client can regard ECH as securely disabled by the server. As below, it
SHOULD then retry the handshake with a new transport connection and ECH
disabled.

If the field contains any other value, the client MUST abort the connection with
an "illegal_parameter" alert.

If the server negotiates an earlier version of TLS, or if it does not provide an
"encrypted_client_hello" extension in EncryptedExtensions, the client proceeds
with the handshake, authenticating for ECHConfigContents.public_name as
described in {{auth-public-name}}. If an earlier version was negotiated, the
client MUST NOT enable the False Start optimization {{RFC7918}} for this
handshake. If authentication or the handshake fails, the client MUST return a
failure to the calling application. It MUST NOT treat this as a secure signal to
disable ECH.

Otherwise, when the handshake completes successfully with the public name
authenticated, the client MUST abort the connection with an "ech_required"
alert. The client can then regard ECH as securely disabled by the server. It
SHOULD retry the handshake with a new transport connection and ECH disabled.

Clients SHOULD implement a limit on retries caused by "ech_retry_request" or
servers which do not acknowledge the "encrypted_client_hello" extension. If the
client does not retry in either scenario, it MUST report an error to the calling
application.

#### Authenticating for the public name {#auth-public-name}

When the server cannot decrypt or does not process the "encrypted_client_hello"
extension, it continues with the handshake using the plaintext "server_name"
extension instead (see {{server-behavior}}). Clients that offer ECH then
authenticate the connection with the public name, as follows:

- If the server resumed a session or negotiated a session that did not use a
  certificate for authentication, the client MUST abort the connection with an
  "illegal_parameter" alert. This case is invalid because {{send-ech}} requires
  the client to only offer ECH-established sessions, and {{server-behavior}}
  requires the server to decline ECH-established sessions if it did not accept
  ECH.

- The client MUST verify that the certificate is valid for
  ECHConfigContents.public_name. If invalid, it MUST abort the connection with
  the appropriate alert.

- If the server requests a client certificate, the client MUST respond with an
  empty Certificate message, denoting no client certificate.

Note that authenticating a connection for the public name does not authenticate
it for the origin. The TLS implementation MUST NOT report such connections as
successful to the application. It additionally MUST ignore all session tickets
and session IDs presented by the server. These connections are only used to
trigger retries, as described in {{handle-server-response}}. This may be
implemented, for instance, by reporting a failed connection with a dedicated
error code.

### HelloRetryRequest

If the server sends a HelloRetryRequest in response to the ClientHello, the
client sends a second updated ClientHello per the rules in {{RFC8446}}.
However, at this point, the client does not know whether the server processed
ClientHelloOuter or ClientHelloInner, and MUST regenerate both values to be
acceptable. Note: if the inner and outer ClientHellos use different groups for
their key shares or differ in some other way, then the HelloRetryRequest may
actually be invalid for one or the other ClientHello, in which case a fresh
ClientHello MUST be generated, ignoring the instructions in HelloRetryRequest.
Otherwise, the usual rules for HelloRetryRequest processing apply.

Clients bind encryption of the second ClientHelloInner to encryption of the
first ClientHelloInner via the derived ech_hrr_key by modifying HPKE setup as
follows:

~~~
pkR = Deserialize(ECHConfig.public_key)
enc, context = SetupPSKS(pkR, "tls13-ech-hrr", ech_hrr_key, "")
ech_nonce_value = context.Export("tls13-ech-hrr-nonce", 16)
~~~

Clients then encrypt the second ClientHelloInner using this new HPKE context.
In doing so, the encrypted value is also authenticated by ech_hrr_key. The
rationale for this is described in {{flow-hrr-hijack}}.

Client-facing servers perform the corresponding process when decrypting second
ClientHelloInner messages. In particular, upon receipt of a second ClientHello
message with a ClientEncryptedCH value, servers setup their HPKE context and
decrypt ClientEncryptedCH as follows:

~~~
context = SetupPSKR(ClientEncryptedCH.enc,
  skR, "tls13-ech-hrr", ech_hrr_key, "")

ClientHelloInner =
  context.Open("", ClientEncryptedCH.encrypted_ch)

ech_nonce_value = context.Export("tls13-ech-hrr-nonce", 16)
~~~

[[OPEN ISSUE: Should we be using the PSK input or the info input?  On the one
hand, the requirements on info seem weaker, but maybe actually this needs to be
secret? Analysis needed.]]

## GREASE extensions {#grease-extensions}

If the client attempts to connect to a server and does not have an ECHConfig
structure available for the server, it SHOULD send a GREASE {{?RFC8701}}
"encrypted_client_hello" extension as follows:

- Set the "suite" field  to a supported HpkeCipherSuite. The selection SHOULD
  vary to exercise all supported configurations, but MAY be held constant for
  successive connections to the same server in the same session.

- Set the "config_id" field to a randomly-generated string of `Nh` bytes,
  where `Nh` is the output length of the `Extract` function of the KDF
  associated with the chosen cipher suite. (The KDF API is specified in
  {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}.)

- Set the "enc" field to a randomly-generated valid encapsulated public key
  output by the HPKE KEM.

- Set the "encrypted_ch" field to a randomly-generated string of L bytes, where
  L is the size of the ClientHelloInner message the client would use given an
  ECHConfig structure, padded according to {{padding}}.

If the server sends an "encrypted_client_hello" extension, the client MUST check
the extension syntactically and abort the connection with a "decode_error" alert
if it is invalid.

Offering a GREASE extension is not considered offering an encrypted ClientHello
for purposes of requirements in {{client-behavior}}. In particular, the client
MAY offer to resume sessions established without ECH.

# Client-Facing Server Behavior {#server-behavior}

Upon receiving an "encrypted_client_hello" extension, the client-facing server
MUST check that it is able to negotiate TLS 1.3 or greater. If not, it MUST
abort the connection with a "handshake_failure" alert.

The ClientEncryptedCH value is said to match a known ECHConfig if there exists
an ECHConfig that can be used to successfully decrypt
ClientEncryptedCH.encrypted_ch. This matching procedure should be done using
one of the following two checks:

1. Compare ClientEncryptedCH.config_id against identifiers of known ECHConfig
   and choose the one that matches.
2. Use trial decryption of ClientEncryptedCH.encrypted_ch with known ECHConfig
   and choose the one that succeeds.

Some uses of ECH, such as local discovery mode, may omit the
ClientEncryptedCH.config_id since it can be used as a tracking vector. In
such cases, trial decryption should be used for matching ClientEncryptedCH to
known ECHConfig. Unless specified by the application using (D)TLS or externally
configured on both sides, implementations MUST use the first method.

If the ClientEncryptedCH value does not match any known ECHConfig structure, it
MUST ignore the extension and proceed with the connection, with the following
added behavior:

- It MUST include the "encrypted_client_hello" extension with the
  "retry_configs" field set to one or more ECHConfig structures with up-to-date
  keys. Servers MAY supply multiple ECHConfig values of different versions. This
  allows a server to support multiple versions at once.

- The server MUST ignore all PSK identities in the ClientHello which correspond
  to ECH PSKs. ECH PSKs offered by the client are associated with the ECH
  name. The server was unable to decrypt then ECH name, so it should not resume
  them when using the plaintext SNI name. This restriction allows a client to
  reject resumptions in {{auth-public-name}}.

Note that an unrecognized ClientEncryptedCH.config_id value may be a GREASE
ECH extension (see {{grease-extensions}}), so it is necessary for servers to
proceed with the connection and rely on the client to abort if ECH was required.
In particular, the unrecognized value alone does not indicate a misconfigured
ECH advertisement ({{misconfiguration}}). Instead, servers can measure
occurrences of the "ech_required" alert to detect this case.

If the ClientEncryptedCH value matches a known ECHConfig, the server then
decrypts ClientEncryptedCH.encrypted_ch, using the private key skR corresponding
to ECHConfig, as follows:

~~~
context = SetupBaseR(ClientEncryptedCH.enc, skR, "tls13-ech")

ClientHelloInner =
  context.Open("", ClientEncryptedCH.encrypted_ch)

ech_nonce_value = context.Export("tls13-ech-nonce", 16)
ech_hrr_key = context.Export("tls13-ech-hrr-key", 16)
~~~

If decryption fails, the server MUST abort the connection with a "decrypt_error"
alert. Moreover, if there is no "ech_nonce" extension, or if its value does not
match the derived ech_nonce, the server MUST abort the connection with a
"decrypt_error" alert. Next, the server MUST scan ClientHelloInner for any
"outer_extension" extensions and substitute their values with the values in
ClientHelloOuter. It MUST first verify that the hash found in the extension
matches the hash of the extension to be interpolated in and if it does not,
abort the connections with a "decrypt_error" alert.

Upon determining the true SNI, the client-facing server then either serves the
connection directly (if in Shared Mode), in which case it executes the steps in
the following section, or forwards the TLS connection to the backend server (if
in Split Mode). In the latter case, it does not make any changes to the TLS
messages, but just blindly forwards them.

If the server sends a NewSessionTicket message, the corresponding ECH PSK MUST
be ignored by all other servers in the deployment when not negotiating ECH,
including servers which do not implement this specification.


# Compatibility Issues

Unlike most TLS extensions, placing the SNI value in an ECH extension is not
interoperable with existing servers, which expect the value in the existing
plaintext extension. Thus server operators SHOULD ensure servers understand a
given set of ECH keys before advertising them. Additionally, servers SHOULD
retain support for any previously-advertised keys for the duration of their
validity

However, in more complex deployment scenarios, this may be difficult to fully
guarantee. Thus this protocol was designed to be robust in case of
inconsistencies between systems that advertise ECH keys and servers, at the cost
of extra round-trips due to a retry. Two specific scenarios are detailed below.

## Misconfiguration and Deployment Concerns {#misconfiguration}

It is possible for ECH advertisements and servers to become inconsistent. This
may occur, for instance, from DNS misconfiguration, caching issues, or an
incomplete rollout in a multi-server deployment. This may also occur if a server
loses its ECH keys, or if a deployment of ECH must be rolled back on the server.

The retry mechanism repairs inconsistencies, provided the server is
authoritative for the public name. If server and advertised keys mismatch, the
server will respond with ech_retry_requested. If the server does not understand
the "encrypted_client_hello" extension at all, it will ignore it as required by
{{RFC8446}}; Section 4.1.2. Provided the server can present a certificate valid
for the public name, the client can safely retry with updated settings, as
described in {{handle-server-response}}.

Unless ECH is disabled as a result of successfully establishing a connection to
the public name, the client MUST NOT fall back to using unencrypted
ClientHellos, as this allows a network attacker to disclose the contents of this
ClientHello, including the SNI. It MAY attempt to use another server from the
DNS results, if one is provided.

## Middleboxes

A more serious problem is MITM proxies which do not support this extension.
{{RFC8446}}, Section 9.3 requires that such proxies remove any extensions they
do not understand. The handshake will then present a certificate based on the
public name, without echoing the "encrypted_client_hello" extension to the
client.

Depending on whether the client is configured to accept the proxy's certificate
as authoritative for the public name, this may trigger the retry logic described
in {{handle-server-response}} or result in a connection failure. A proxy which
is not authoritative for the public name cannot forge a signal to disable ECH.

A non-conformant MITM proxy which instead forwards the ECH extension,
substituting its own KeyShare value, will result in the client-facing server
recognizing the key, but failing to decrypt the SNI. This causes a hard failure.
Clients SHOULD NOT attempt to repair the connection in this case.

# Security Considerations

## Security and Privacy Goals

Informally, the primary security and privacy goals of ECH against an active
attacker are as follows:

1. Use of ECH does not weaken the security properties of TLS without ECH.
2. TLS connection establishment to a host with a specific ECHConfig and TLS
   configuration is indistinguishable from a connection to any other host with
   the same ECHConfig and TLS configuration. (The set of hosts which share the
   same ECHConfig and TLS configuration is referred to as the anonymity set.)

Client-facing server configuration determines the size of the anonymity set. For
example, if a client-facing server uses distinct ECHConfig values for each host,
then each anonymity set has size k = 1. Client-facing servers SHOULD deploy ECH
in such a way so as to maximize the size of the anonymity set where possible.
This means client-facing servers should use the same ECHConfig for as many hosts
as possible. An attacker can distinguish two hosts that have different ECHConfig
values based on the ClientEncryptedCH.config_id value. This also means
public information in a TLS handshake is also consistent across hosts. For
example, if a client-facing server services many backend origin hosts, only one
of which supports some cipher suite, it may be possible to identify that host
based on the contents of unencrypted handshake messages.

## Unauthenticated and Plaintext DNS {#plaintext-dns}

In comparison to {{?I-D.kazuho-protected-sni}}, wherein DNS Resource Records are
signed via a server private key, ECH records have no authenticity or provenance
information. This means that any attacker which can inject DNS responses or
poison DNS caches, which is a common scenario in client access networks, can
supply clients with fake ECH records (so that the client encrypts data to them)
or strip the ECH record from the response. However, in the face of an attacker
that controls DNS, no encryption scheme can work because the attacker can
replace the IP address, thus blocking client connections, or substituting a
unique IP address which is 1:1 with the DNS name that was looked up (modulo DNS
wildcards). Thus, allowing the ECH records in the clear does not make the
situation significantly worse.

Clearly, DNSSEC (if the client validates and hard fails) is a defense against
this form of attack, but DoH/DPRIVE are also defenses against DNS attacks by
attackers on the local network, which is a common case where ClientHello and SNI
encryption are desired. Moreover, as noted in the introduction, SNI encryption
is less useful without encryption of DNS queries in transit via DoH or DPRIVE
mechanisms.

## Client Tracking

A malicious client-facing server could distribute unique, per-client ECHConfig
structures as a way of tracking clients across subsequent connections. On-path
adversaries which know about these unique keys could also track clients in this
way by observing TLS connection attempts.

The cost of this type of attack scales linearly with the desired number of
target clients. Moreover, DNS caching behavior makes targeting individual users
for extended periods of time, e.g., using per-client ECHConfig structures
delivered via HTTPS RRs with high TTLs, challenging. Clients can help mitigate
this problem by flushing any DNS or ECHConfig state upon changing networks.

## Optional Configuration Identifiers and Trial Decryption {#optional-configs}

Optional configuration identifiers may be useful in scenarios where clients and
client-facing servers do not want to reveal information about the client-facing
server in the "encrypted_client_hello" extension. In such settings, clients send
either an empty config_id or a randomly generated config_id in the
ClientEncryptedCH. (The precise implementation choice for this mechanism is out
of scope for this document.) Servers in these settings must perform trial
decryption since they cannot identify the client's chosen ECH key using the
config_id value. As a result, support for optional configuration identifiers may
exacerbate DoS attacks. Specifically, an adversary may send malicious
ClientHello messages, i.e., those which will not decrypt with any known ECH key,
in order to force wasteful decryption. Servers that support this feature should,
for example, implement some form of rate limiting mechanism to limit the damage
caused by such attacks.

## Outer ClientHello

Any information that the client includes in the ClientHelloOuter is visible to
passive observers. The client SHOULD NOT send values in the ClientHelloOuter
which would reveal a sensitive ClientHelloInner property, such as the true
server name. It MAY send values associated with the public name in the
ClientHelloOuter.

In particular, some extensions require the client send a server-name-specific
value in the ClientHello. These values may reveal information about the
true server name. For example, the "cached_info" ClientHello extension
{{?RFC7924}} can contain the hash of a previously observed server certificate.
The client SHOULD NOT send values associated with the true server name in the
ClientHelloOuter. It MAY send such values in the ClientHelloInner.

Values which are independent of the true server name, or other information the
client wishes to protect, MAY be included in ClientHelloOuter and compressed as
described in {{outer-extensions}}.

## Related Privacy Leaks

ECH requires encrypted DNS to be an effective privacy protection mechanism.
However, verifying the server's identity from the Certificate message,
particularly when using the X509 CertificateType, may result in additional
network traffic that may reveal the server identity. Examples of this traffic
may include requests for revocation information, such as OCSP or CRL traffic, or
requests for repository information, such as authorityInformationAccess. It may
also include implementation-specific traffic for additional information sources
as part of verification.

Implementations SHOULD avoid leaking information that may identify the server.
Even when sent over an encrypted transport, such requests may result in indirect
exposure of the server's identity, such as indicating a specific CA or service
being used. To mitigate this risk, servers SHOULD deliver such information
in-band when possible, such as through the use of OCSP stapling, and clients
SHOULD take steps to minimize or protect such requests during certificate
validation.

## Comparison Against Criteria

{{?RFC8744}} lists several requirements for SNI encryption.
In this section, we re-iterate these requirements and assess the ECH design
against them.

### Mitigate against replay attacks

Since servers process either ClientHelloInner or ClientHelloOuter, and
ClientHelloInner contains an HPKE-derived nonce, it is not possible for an
attacker to "cut and paste" the ECH value in a different Client Hello and learn
information from ClientHelloInner. This is because the attacker lacks access to
the HPKE-derived nonce used to derive the handshake secrets.

### Avoid widely-deployed shared secrets

This design depends upon DNS as a vehicle for semi-static public key
distribution. Server operators may partition their private keys however they
see fit provided each server behind an IP address has the corresponding private
key to decrypt a key. Thus, when one ECH key is provided, sharing is optimally
bound by the number of hosts that share an IP address. Server operators may
further limit sharing by publishing different DNS records containing ECHConfig
values with different keys using a short TTL.

### Prevent SNI-based DoS attacks

This design requires servers to decrypt ClientHello messages with
ClientEncryptedCH extensions carrying valid digests. Thus, it is possible for an
attacker to force decryption operations on the server. This attack is bound by
the number of valid TCP connections an attacker can open.

### Do not stick out

The only explicit signal indicating possible use of ECH is the ClientHello
"encrypted_client_hello" extension. Server handshake messages do not contain any
signal indicating use or negotiation of ECH. Clients MAY GREASE the
"encrypted_client_hello" extension, as described in {{grease-extensions}}, which
helps ensure the ecosystem handles ECH correctly. Moreover, as more clients
enable ECH support, e.g., as normal part of Web browser functionality, with keys
supplied by shared hosting providers, the presence of ECH extensions becomes
less unusual and part of typical client behavior. In other words, if all Web
browsers start using ECH, the presence of this value will not signal unusual
behavior to passive eavesdroppers.

### Forward secrecy

This design is not forward secret because the server's ECH key is static.
However, the window of exposure is bound by the key lifetime. It is RECOMMENDED
that servers rotate keys frequently.

### Proper security context

This design permits servers operating in Split Mode to forward connections
directly to backend origin servers, thereby avoiding unnecessary MiTM attacks.

### Split server spoofing

Assuming ECH records retrieved from DNS are authenticated, e.g., via DNSSEC or
fetched from a trusted Recursive Resolver, spoofing a server operating in Split
Mode is not possible. See {{plaintext-dns}} for more details regarding plaintext
DNS.

Authenticating the ECHConfigs structure naturally authenticates the included
public name. This also authenticates any retry signals from the server because
the client validates the server certificate against the public name before
retrying.

### Supporting multiple protocols

This design has no impact on application layer protocol negotiation. It may
affect connection routing, server certificate selection, and client certificate
verification. Thus, it is compatible with multiple protocols.

## Padding Policy

Variations in the length of the ClientHelloInner ciphertext could leak
information about the corresponding plaintext. {{padding}} describes a
RECOMMENDED padding mechanism for clients aimed at reducing potential
information leakage.

## Active Attack Mitigations

This section describes the rationale for ECH properties and mechanics as
defenses against active attacks. In all the attacks below, the attacker is
on-path between the target client and server. The goal of the attacker is to
learn private information about the inner ClientHello, such as the true SNI
value.

### Client Reaction Attack Mitigation {#flow-client-reaction}

This attack uses the client's reaction to an incorrect certificate as an oracle.
The attacker intercepts a legitimate ClientHello and replies with a ServerHello,
Certificate, CertificateVerify, and Finished messages, wherein the Certificate
message contains a "test" certificate for the domain name it wishes to query. If
the client decrypted the Certificate and failed verification (or leaked
information about its verification process by a timing side channel), the
attacker learns that its test certificate name was incorrect. As an example,
suppose the client's SNI value in its inner ClientHello is "example.com," and
the attacker replied with a Certificate for "test.com". If the client produces a
verification failure alert because of the mismatch faster than it would due to
the Certificate signature validation, information about the name leaks. Note
that the attacker can also withhold the CertificateVerify message. In that
scenario, a client which first verifies the Certificate would then respond
similarly and leak the same information.

   Alert
                 ------>
~~~
{: #flow-diagram-client-reaction title="Client reaction attack"}

The "ech_nonce" extension in the inner ClientHello prevents this attack. In
particular, since the attacker does not have access to this value, it cannot
produce the right transcript and handshake keys needed for encrypting the
Certificate message. Thus, the client will fail to decrypt the Certificate and
abort the connection.

### HelloRetryRequest Hijack Mitigation {#flow-hrr-hijack}

This attack aims to exploit server HRR state management to recover information
about a legitimate ClientHello using its own attacker-controlled ClientHello.
To begin, the attacker intercepts and forwards a legitimate ClientHello with an
"encrypted_client_hello" (ech) extension to the server, which triggers a
legitimate HelloRetryRequest in return. Rather than forward the retry to the
client, the attacker, attempts to generate its own ClientHello in response based
on the contents of the first ClientHello and HelloRetryRequest exchange with the
result that the server encrypts the Certificate to the attacker. If the server
used the SNI from the first ClientHello and the key share from the second
(attacker-controlled) ClientHello, the Certificate produced would leak the
client's chosen SNI to the attacker.

~~~
{: #flow-diagram-hrr-hijack title="HelloRetryRequest hijack attack"}

This attack is mitigated by binding the first and second ClientHello messages
together. In particular, since the attacker does not possess the ech_hrr_key, it
cannot generate a valid encryption of the second inner ClientHello. The server
will attempt decryption using ech_hrr_key, detect failure, and fail the
connection.

If the second ClientHello were not bound to the first, it might be possible for
the server to act as an oracle if it required parameters from the first
ClientHello to match that of the second ClientHello. For example, imagine the
client's original SNI value in the inner ClientHello is "example.com", and the
attacker's hijacked SNI value in its inner ClientHello is "test.com". A server
which checks these for equality and changes behavior based on the result can be
used as an oracle to learn the client's SNI.

### Resumption PSK Oracle Mitigation {#flow-resumption-oracle}

This attack uses resumption PSKs as an oracle for dictionary attacks against a
given ClientHello's true SNI. To begin, the attacker first interacts with a
server to obtain a resumption ticket for a given test domain, such as
"test.com". Later, upon receipt of a legitimate ClientHello without a PSK
binder, it computes a PSK binder using its own ticket and forwards the resulting
ClientHello. Assume the server then validates the PSK binder on the outer
ClientHello and chooses connection parameters based on the inner ClientHello. A
server which then validates information in the outer ClientHello ticket against
information in the inner ClientHello, such as the SNI, introduces an oracle that
can be used to test the encrypted SNI value of specific ClientHello messages.

{: #tls-resumption-psk title="Message flow for resumption and PSK"}

ECH mitigates against this attack by requiring servers not mix-and-match
information from the inner and outer ClientHello. For example, if the server
accepts the inner ClientHello, it does not validate binders in the outer
ClientHello. This means that ECH PSKs are used within the HPKE encryption
envelope.

# IANA Considerations

## Update of the TLS ExtensionType Registry {#alerts}

IANA is requested to create the following two entries in the existing registry
for ExtensionType (defined in {{!RFC8446}}):

1. encrypted_client_hello(0xff02), with "TLS 1.3" column values being set to
   "CH, EE", and "Recommended" column being set to "Yes".
2. ech_nonce(0xff03), with the "TLS 1.3" column values being set to "CH", and
   "Recommended" column being set to "Yes".
3. outer_extension(0xff04), with the "Recommended" column being set to "Yes".
3. outer_extension_binder(0xff05), with the "Recommended" column being set to
   "Yes".

## Update of the TLS Alert Registry

IANA is requested to create an entry, ech_required(121) in the existing registry
for Alerts (defined in {{!RFC8446}}), with the "DTLS-OK" column being set to
"Y".

# ECHConfig Extension Guidance {#config-extensions-guidance}

Any future information or hints that influence the outer ClientHello SHOULD be
specified as ECHConfig extensions, or in an entirely new version of ECHConfig.
This is primarily because the outer ClientHello exists only in support of ECH.
Namely, it is both an envelope for the encrypted inner ClientHello and enabler
for authenticated key mismatch signals (see {{server-behavior}}). In contrast,
the inner ClientHello is the true ClientHello used upon ECH negotiation.

# Alternative SNI Protection Designs

Alternative approaches to encrypted SNI may be implemented at the TLS or
application layer. In this section we describe several alternatives and discuss
drawbacks in comparison to the design in this document.

## TLS-layer

### TLS in Early Data

In this variant, TLS Client Hellos are tunneled within early data payloads
belonging to outer TLS connections established with the client-facing server.
This requires clients to have established a previous session -— and obtained
PSKs —- with the server. The client-facing server decrypts early data payloads
to uncover Client Hellos destined for the backend server, and forwards them
onwards as necessary. Afterwards, all records to and from backend servers are
forwarded by the client-facing server -- unmodified. This avoids double
encryption of TLS records.

Problems with this approach are: (1) servers may not always be able to
distinguish inner Client Hellos from legitimate application data, (2) nested
0-RTT data may not function correctly, (3) 0-RTT data may not be supported --
especially under DoS -- leading to availability concerns, and (4) clients must
bootstrap tunnels (sessions), costing an additional round trip and potentially
revealing the SNI during the initial connection. In contrast, encrypted SNI
protects the SNI in a distinct Client Hello extension and neither abuses early
data nor requires a bootstrapping connection.

### Combined Tickets

In this variant, client-facing and backend servers coordinate to produce
"combined tickets" that are consumable by both. Clients offer combined tickets
to client-facing servers. The latter parse them to determine the correct backend
server to which the Client Hello should be forwarded. This approach is
problematic due to non-trivial coordination between client-facing and backend
servers for ticket construction and consumption. Moreover, it requires a
bootstrapping step similar to that of the previous variant. In contrast,
encrypted SNI requires no such coordination.

## Application-layer

### HTTP/2 CERTIFICATE Frames

In this variant, clients request secondary certificates with CERTIFICATE_REQUEST
HTTP/2 frames after TLS connection completion. In response, servers supply
certificates via TLS exported authenticators
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-exported-authenticator}} in CERTIFICATE frames. Clients use a
generic SNI for the underlying client-facing server TLS connection. Problems
with this approach include: (1) one additional round trip before peer
authentication, (2) non-trivial application-layer dependencies and interaction,
and (3) obtaining the generic SNI to bootstrap the connection. In contrast,
encrypted SNI induces no additional round trip and operates below the
application layer.


# Total Client Hello Encryption

The design described here only provides encryption for the SNI, but not for
other extensions, such as ALPN. Another potential design would be to encrypt all
of the extensions using the same basic structure as we use here for ECH. That
design has the following advantages:

- It protects all the extensions from ordinary eavesdroppers
- If the encrypted block has its own KeyShare, it does not necessarily require
  the client to use a single KeyShare, because the client's share is bound to
  the SNI by the AEAD (analysis needed).

It also has the following disadvantages:

- The client-facing server can still see the other extensions. By contrast we
  could introduce another EncryptedExtensions block that was encrypted to the
  backend server and not the client-facing server.
- It requires a mechanism for the client-facing server to provide the
  extension-encryption key to the backend server and thus cannot be used with an
  unmodified backend server.
- A conforming middlebox will strip every extension, which might result in a
  ClientHello which is just unacceptable to the server (more analysis needed).

This document draws extensively from ideas in {{?I-D.kazuho-protected-sni}}, but
is a much more limited mechanism because it depends on the DNS for the
protection of the ECH key. Richard Barnes, Christian Huitema, Patrick McManus,
Matthew Prince, Nick Sullivan, Martin Thomson, and David Benjamin also provided
important ideas and contributions.
