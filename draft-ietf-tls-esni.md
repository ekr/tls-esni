# Introduction {#intro}

DISCLAIMER: This is very early a work-in-progress design and has not yet seen
significant (or really any) security analysis. It should not be used as a basis
for building production systems.

Although TLS 1.3 {{!RFC8446}} encrypts most of the handshake, including the
server certificate, there are several ways in which an on-path attacker can
learn private information about the connection. The plaintext Server Name
Indication (SNI) extension in ClientHello messages, which leaks the target
domain for a given connection, is perhaps the most sensitive information
unencrypted in TLS 1.3.

The target domain may also be visible through other channels, such as plaintext
client DNS queries, visible server IP addresses (assuming the server does not
use domain-based virtual hosting), or other indirect mechanisms such as traffic
analysis. DoH {{?RFC8484}} and DPRIVE {{?RFC7858}}
{{?RFC8094}} provide mechanisms for clients to conceal DNS lookups from network
inspection, and many TLS servers host multiple domains on the same IP address.
In such environments, the SNI remains the primary explicit signal used to
determine the server's identity.

The TLS Working Group has studied the problem of protecting the SNI, but has
been unable to develop a completely generic solution.
{{?RFC8744}} provides a description of the problem space and
some of the proposed techniques. One of the more difficult problems is "Do not
stick out" ({{?RFC8744}}, Section 3.4): if only sensitive or
private services use SNI encryption, then SNI encryption is a signal that a
client is going to such a service. For this reason, much recent work has focused
on concealing the fact that the SNI is being protected. Unfortunately, the
result often has undesirable performance consequences, incomplete coverage, or
both.

The protocol specified by this document takes a different approach. It assumes
that private origins will co-locate with or hide behind a provider (reverse
proxy, application server, etc.) that protects sensitive ClientHello parameters,
including the SNI, for all of the domains it hosts. These co-located servers
form an anonymity set wherein all elements have a consistent configuration,
e.g., the set of supported application protocols, ciphersuites, TLS versions,
and so on. Usage of this mechanism reveals that a client is connecting to a
particular service provider, but does not reveal which server from the anonymity
set terminates the connection. Thus, it leaks no more than what is already
visible from the server IP address.

This document specifies a new TLS extension, called Encrypted Client Hello
(ECH), that allows clients to encrypt their ClientHello to a supporting server.
This protects the SNI and other potentially sensitive fields, such as the ALPN
list {{?RFC7301}}. This extension is only supported with (D)TLS 1.3 {{!RFC8446}}
and newer versions of the protocol.

# Overview

This protocol is designed to operate in one of two topologies illustrated below,
which we call "Shared Mode" and "Split Mode".

## Topologies

                |                     |

                +---------------------+
                        Server
~~~~
{: #shared-mode title="Shared Mode Topology"}

In Shared Mode, the provider is the origin server for all the domains whose DNS
records point to it. In this mode, the TLS connection is terminated by the
provider.

            Client-Facing Server            Backend Server
~~~~
{: #split-mode title="Split Mode Topology"}

In Split Mode, the provider is not the origin server for private domains.
Rather, the DNS records for private domains point to the provider, and the
provider's server relays the connection back to the origin server, who
terminates the TLS connection with the client. Importantly, service provider
does not have access to the plaintext of the connection.

In the remainder of this document, we will refer to the ECH-service provider as
the "client-facing server" and to the TLS terminator as the "backend server".
These are the same entity in Shared Mode, but in Split Mode, the client-facing
and backend servers are physically separated.

## Encrypted ClientHello (ECH)

ECH allows the client to encrypt sensitive ClientHello extensions, e.g., SNI,
ALPN, etc., under the public key of the client-facing server. This requires the
client-facing server to publish the public key and metadata it uses for ECH for
all the domains for which it serves directly or indirectly (via Split Mode).
This document defines the format of the ECH encryption public key and metadata,
referred to as an ECH configuration, and delegates DNS publication details to
{{!HTTPS-RR=I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https}}, though other delivery mechanisms are
possible. In particular, if some of the clients of a private server are
applications rather than Web browsers, those applications might have the public
key and metadata preconfigured.

When a client wants to establish a TLS session with the backend server, it
constructs its ClientHello as usual (we will refer to this as the
ClientHelloInner message) and then encrypts this message using the public key of
the ECH configuration. It then constructs a new ClientHello (ClientHelloOuter)
with innocuous values for sensitive extensions, e.g., SNI, ALPN, etc., and with
an "encrypted_client_hello" extension, which this document defines
({{encrypted-client-hello}}). The extension's payload carries the encrypted
ClientHelloInner and specifies the ECH configuration used for encryption.
Finally, it sends ClientHelloOuter to the server.

Upon receiving the ClientHelloOuter, the client-facing server takes one of the
following actions:

1. If it does not support ECH, it ignores the "encrypted_client_hello" extension
   and proceeds with the handshake as usual, per {{RFC8446}}, Section 4.1.2.
1. If it supports ECH but does not recognize the configuration specified by the
   client, then it ignores the extension and terminates the handshake using the
   ClientHelloOuter. This is referred to as "ECH rejection". When ECH is
   rejected, the server sends an acceptable ECH configuration in its
   EncryptedExtensions message.
1. If it supports ECH and recognizes the configuration, then it attempts to
   decrypt the ClientHelloInner. It aborts the handshake if decryption fails;
   otherwise it forwards the ClientHelloInner to the backend, who terminates the
   connection. This is referred to as "ECH acceptance".

Upon receiving the server's response, the client determines whether or not ECH
was accepted and proceeds with the handshake accordingly. (See
{{client-behavior}} for details.)

Informally, a primary goal of ECH is ensuring that connections to servers in the
same anonymity set are indistinguishable from one another without affecting any
existing security properties of TLS 1.3. See {{goals}} for more details about
the ECH security and privacy goals.

# Encrypted ClientHello Configuration {#ech-configuration}

ECH uses HPKE for public key encryption {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}. The ECH
configuration is defined by the following `ECHConfigs` structure.

~~~~
    opaque HpkePublicKey<1..2^16-1>;
    uint16 HpkeKemId;  // Defined in I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke
    uint16 HpkeKdfId;  // Defined in I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke
    uint16 HpkeAeadId; // Defined in I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke

    struct {
        HpkeKdfId kdf_id;
        HpkeAeadId aead_id;
    } ECHCipherSuite;

    struct {
        opaque public_name<1..2^16-1>;

        HpkePublicKey public_key;
        HpkeKemId kem_id;
        ECHCipherSuite cipher_suites<4..2^16-4>;

        uint16 maximum_name_length;
        Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
    } ECHConfigContents;

    struct {
        uint16 version;
        uint16 length;
        select (ECHConfig.version) {
          case 0xff08: ECHConfigContents contents;
        }
    } ECHConfig;

    ECHConfig ECHConfigs<1..2^16-1>;
~~~~

The `ECHConfigs` structure contains one or more `ECHConfig` structures in
decreasing order of preference. This allows a server to support multiple
versions of ECH and multiple sets of ECH parameters.

The `ECHConfig` structure contains the following fields:

version
: The version of ECH for which this configuration is used. Beginning with
draft-08, the version is the same as the code point for the
"encrypted_client_hello" extension. Clients MUST ignore any `ECHConfig`
structure with a version they do not support.

length
: The length, in bytes, of the next field.

contents
: An opaque byte string whose contents depend on the version. For this
specification, the contents are an `ECHConfigContents` structure.

The `ECHConfigContents` structure contains the following fields:

public_name
: The non-empty name of client-facing server, i.e., the entity trusted to update
these encryption keys. This is used to repair misconfigurations, as described in
{{handle-server-response}}.

public_key
: The HPKE public key used by the client to encrypt ClientHelloInner.

kem_id
: The HPKE KEM identifier corresponding to `public_key`. Clients MUST ignore any
`ECHConfig` structure with a key using a KEM they do not support.

cipher_suites
: The list of HPKE AEAD and KDF identifier pairs clients can use for encrypting
ClientHelloInner.

maximum_name_length
: The largest name the server expects to support, if known. If this value is
not known it can be set to zero, in which case clients SHOULD use the inner
ClientHello padding scheme described below. That could happen if wildcard names
are in use, or if names can be added or removed from the anonymity set during
the lifetime of a particular resource record value.

extensions
: A list of extensions that the client must take into consideration when
generating a ClientHello message. These are described below
({{config-extensions}}).

## Configuration Extensions {#config-extensions}

ECH configuration extensions are used to to provide room for additional
functionality as needed. See {{config-extensions-guidance}} for guidance on
which types of extensions are appropriate for this structure.

The format is as defined in {{RFC8446}}, Section 4.2.
The same interpretation rules apply: extensions MAY appear in any order, but
there MUST NOT be more than one extension of the same type in the extensions
block. An extension can be tagged as mandatory by using an extension type
codepoint with the high order bit set to 1. A client that receives a mandatory
extension they do not understand MUST reject the `ECHConfig` content.

Clients MUST parse the extension list and check for unsupported mandatory
extensions. If an unsupported mandatory extension is present, clients MUST
ignore the `ECHConfig`.

# The "encrypted_client_hello" extension {#encrypted-client-hello}

The encrypted ClientHelloInner is carried in an "encrypted_client_hello"
extension, defined as follows:

~~~
    enum {
       encrypted_client_hello(0xff08), (65535)
    } ExtensionType;
~~~

The extension request is carried by the ClientHelloOuter, i.e., the ClientHello
transmitted to the client-facing server. The payload contains the following
`ClientECH` structure:

~~~~
    struct {
       ECHCipherSuite cipher_suite;
       opaque config_id<0..255>;
       opaque enc<1..2^16-1>;
       opaque payload<1..2^16-1>;
    } ClientECH;
~~~~

cipher_suite
: The cipher suite used to encrypt ClientHelloInner. This MUST match a value
provided in the corresponding `ECHConfig.cipher_suites` list.

config_id
: The configuration identifier, equal to
`Expand(Extract("", config), "tls13 ech config id", Nh)`, where `config` is the
`ECHConfig` structure and `Extract`, `Expand`, and `Nh` are as specified by the
cipher suite KDF. (Passing the literal `""` as the salt is interpreted by
`Extract` as no salt being provided.) The length of this value SHOULD NOT be
less than 16 bytes unless it is optional for an application; see
{{optional-configs}}.

enc
: The HPKE encapsulated key, used by servers to decrypt the corresponding
`payload` field.

payload
: The serialized and encrypted ClientHelloInner structure, encrypted using HPKE
as described in {{send-ech}}.

When offering the "encrypted_client_hello" extension in its ClientHelloOuter,
the client MUST also offer an empty "encrypted_client_hello" extension in its
ClientHelloInner, wherever applicable. (This requirement is not applicable when
the extension is generated as described in {{grease-extensions}}.)

When the client offers the "encrypted_client_hello" extension, the server MAY
include an "encrypted_client_hello" extension in its EncryptedExtensions message
with the following payload:

~~~
    struct {
       ECHConfigs retry_configs;
    } ServerECH;
~~~

retry_configs
: An ECHConfigs structure containing one or more ECHConfig structures, in
decreasing order of preference, to be used by the client in subsequent
connection attempts.

This document also defines the "ech_required" alert, which clients MUST send
when it offered an "encrypted_client_hello" extension that was not accepted by
the server. (See {{alerts}}.)

[[OPEN ISSUE: The following text is a remnant of the section on "ech_nonce". It
specifies client/server behavior that is unrelated to "ech_nonce".]]

Per {{client-behavior}} and {{server-behavior}}, implementations are required to
track, alongside each PSK established by a previous connection, whether ECH was
accepted for this connection. If so, this is referred to as an "ECH PSK".
Otherwise, it is a "non-ECH PSK". This may be implemented by adding a new field
to client and server session states.

## Incorporating Outer Extensions {#outer-extensions}

Some TLS 1.3 extensions can be quite large and having them both in the inner and
outer ClientHello will lead to a very large overall size. One particularly
pathological example is "key_share" with post-quantum algorithms. In order to
reduce the impact of duplicated extensions, the client may use the
"outer_extension" extension.

~~~
    enum {
       outer_extension(0xff04), (65535)
    } ExtensionType;

    struct {
       ExtensionType outer_extensions<2..254>;
       uint8 inner_digest<32..255>;
    } OuterExtensions;
~~~

OuterExtensions MUST only be used in ClientHelloInner. It consists of one or
more ExtensionType values, each of which reference an extension in
ClientHelloOuter, and a digest of the complete ClientHelloInner.

When sending ClientHello, the client first computes ClientHelloInner, including
any PSK binders, and then MAY substitute extensions which it knows will be
duplicated in ClientHelloOuter. To do so, the client computes the digest of the
entire ClientHelloInner message as:

~~~
  inner_digest = Expand(Extract("", inner),
                        "tls13 ech inner digest", Nh)
~~~

where `inner` is the ClientHelloInner structure and `Extract`, `Expand`, and
`Nh` are as defined by the KDF API in {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}. Then, the client
removes and replaces extensions from ClientHelloInner with a single
"outer_extension" extension. The list of outer extensions,
OuterExtensions.outer_extensions, includes those which were removed from
ClientHelloInner, in the order in which they were removed.

This process is reversed by client-facing server. Specifically, the server
replaces the "outer_extension" with the corresponding sequence of extensions in
the ClientHelloOuter. The server then computes the digest of the reconstructed
ClientHelloInner. If the digest does not equal OuterExtensions.inner_digest,
then the server MUST abort the connection with a "decrypt_error" alert.

# Client Behavior {#client-behavior}

## Sending an encrypted ClientHello {#send-ech}

To offer ECH, the client first chooses a suitable ECH configuration. To
determine if a given `ECHConfig` is suitable, it checks that it supports the KEM
algorithm identified by `ECHConfig.kem_id` and at least one KDF/AEAD algorithm
identified by `ECHConfig.cipher_suites`. Once a suitable configuration is found,
the client selects the cipher suite it will use for encryption. It MUST NOT
choose a cipher suite not advertised by the configuration.

Next, the client constructs the ClientHelloOuter message just as it does a
standard ClientHello, with the exception of the following rules:

1. It MUST offer to negotiate TLS 1.3 or above.
1. It MUST include an "encrypted_client_hello" extension with a payload
   constructed as described below.
1. The value of `ECHConfig.public_name` MUST be placed in the "server_name"
   extension.
1. It MUST NOT include the "pre_shared_key" extension. [[OPEN ISSUE: The text
   needs to be updated to reflect this rule.]]

The client then constructs the ClientHelloInner message just as it does a
standard ClientHello, with the exception of the following rules:

1. It MUST NOT offer to negotiate TLS 1.2 or below.
1. It MUST NOT offer to resume any non-ECH PSK or any session for TLS 1.2 and
   below.
1. It MAY offer any other extension in the ClientHelloOuter except those that
   have been incorporated into the ClientHelloInner as described in
   {{outer-extensions}}.
1. It MAY copy any other field from the ClientHelloOuter except
   ClientHelloOuter.random. Instead, It MUST generate a fresh
   ClientHelloInner.random using a secure random number generator. (See
   {{flow-client-reaction}}.)
1. It SHOULD contain TLS padding {{!RFC7685}} as described in {{padding}}.
1. If implementing TLS 1.3's compatibility mode (see Appendix D.4 of
   {{RFC8446}}), it MUST copy the legacy\_session\_id field from
   ClientHelloOuter. This allows the server to echo the correct session ID
   when ECH is negotiated.

The client might duplicate non-sensitive extensions in both messages. However,
implementations need to take care to ensure that sensitive extensions are not
offered in the ClientHelloOuter. [[OPEN ISSUE: We should provide guidance on
what extensions are sensitive and suggest suitable substitutes.]]

To encrypt ClientHelloInner, the client first needs to generate the HPKE
encryption context. It computes the encapsulated key, context, and HRR key (see
{{hrr}}) as:

~~~
    pkR = Deserialize(ECHConfig.public_key)
    enc, context = SetupBaseS(pkR, "tls13 ech")
    ech_hrr_key = context.Export("tls13 ech hrr key", 16)
~~~

Note that the HPKE functions Deserialize and SetupBaseS are those which match
`ECHConfig.kem_id` and the AEAD/KDF used with `context` are those which match
client's chosen preference from `ECHConfig.cipher_suites`. The encrypted
ClientHelloInner is computed as:

~~~~
    payload = context.Seal("", ClientHelloInner)
~~~~

The payload of the "encrypted_client_hello" extension in the ClientHelloOuter is
a `ClientECH` with the following values:

- `cipher_suite`, the client's chosen cipher suite;
- `config_id`, the identifier of the chosen ECHConfig structure;
- `enc`, as computed above; and
- `payload`, as computed above.

## Recommended Padding Scheme {#padding}

This section describes a deterministic padding mechanism based on the following
observation: individual extensions can reveal sensitive information through
their length. Thus, each extension in the inner ClientHello may require
different amounts of padding. This padding may be fully determined by the
client's configuration or may require server input.

By way of example, clients typically support a small number of application
profiles. For instance, a browser might support HTTP with ALPN values
["http/1.1, "h2"] and WebRTC media with ALPNs ["webrtc", "c-webrtc"]. Clients
SHOULD pad this extension by rounding up to the total size of the longest ALPN
extension across all application profiles. The target padding length of most
ClientHello extensions can be computed in this way.

In contrast, clients do not know the longest SNI value in the client-facing
server's anonymity set without server input. For the "server_name" extension
with length D, clients SHOULD use the server's length hint L
(ECHCOnfig.maximum_name_length) when computing the padding as follows:

1. If L >= D, add L - D bytes of padding. This rounds to the server's
   advertised hint, i.e., ECHConfig.maximum_name_length.
2. Otherwise, let P = 31 - ((D - 1) % 32), and add P bytes of padding, plus an
   additional 32 bytes if D + P < L + 32. This rounds D up to the nearest
   multiple of 32 bytes that permits at least 32 bytes of length ambiguity.

In addition to padding ClientHelloInner, clients and servers will also need to
pad all other handshake messages that have sensitive-length fields. For example,
if a client proposes ALPN values in ClientHelloInner, the server-selected value
will be returned in an EncryptedExtension, so that handshake message also needs
to be padded using TLS record layer padding.

## Handling the server response {#handle-server-response}

As described in {{server-behavior}}, the server MAY either accept ECH and use
ClientHelloInner or reject it and use ClientHelloOuter. In handling the server's
response, the client's first step is to determine which value was used. The
client presumes acceptance if the last 8 bytes of ServerHello.random are equal
to `accept_confirmation` as defined in {{backend-server-behavior}}. Otherwise,
it presumes rejection.

### Accepted ECH

If the server used ClientHelloInner, the client proceeds with the connection as
usual, authenticating the connection for the origin server.

### Rejected ECH

If the server used ClientHelloOuter, the client proceeds with the handshake,
authenticating for ECHConfig.public_name as described in {{auth-public-name}}.
If authentication or the handshake fails, the client MUST return a failure to
the calling application. It MUST NOT use the retry keys.

Otherwise, when the handshake completes successfully with the public name
authenticated, the client MUST abort the connection with an "ech_required"
alert. It then processes the "retry_configs" field from the server's
"encrypted_client_hello" extension.

If one of the values contains a version supported by the client, it can regard
the ECH keys as securely replaced by the server. It SHOULD retry the handshake
with a new transport connection, using that value to encrypt the ClientHello.
The value may only be applied to the retry connection. The client MUST continue
to use the previously-advertised keys for subsequent connections. This avoids
introducing pinning concerns or a tracking vector, should a malicious server
present client-specific retry keys to identify clients.

If none of the values provided in "retry_configs" contains a supported version,
the client can regard ECH as securely disabled by the server. As below, it
SHOULD then retry the handshake with a new transport connection and ECH
disabled.

If the field contains any other value, the client MUST abort the connection with
an "illegal_parameter" alert.

If the server negotiates an earlier version of TLS, or if it does not provide an
"encrypted_client_hello" extension in EncryptedExtensions, the client proceeds
with the handshake, authenticating for ECHConfigContents.public_name as
described in {{auth-public-name}}. If an earlier version was negotiated, the
client MUST NOT enable the False Start optimization {{RFC7918}} for this
handshake. If authentication or the handshake fails, the client MUST return a
failure to the calling application. It MUST NOT treat this as a secure signal to
disable ECH.

Otherwise, when the handshake completes successfully with the public name
authenticated, the client MUST abort the connection with an "ech_required"
alert. The client can then regard ECH as securely disabled by the server. It
SHOULD retry the handshake with a new transport connection and ECH disabled.

Clients SHOULD implement a limit on retries caused by "ech_retry_request" or
servers which do not acknowledge the "encrypted_client_hello" extension. If the
client does not retry in either scenario, it MUST report an error to the calling
application.

#### Authenticating for the public name {#auth-public-name}

When the server rejects ECH or otherwise ignores "encrypted_client_hello"
extension, it continues with the handshake using the plaintext "server_name"
extension instead (see {{server-behavior}}). Clients that offer ECH then
authenticate the connection with the public name, as follows:

- The client MUST verify that the certificate is valid for
  ECHConfigContents.public_name. If invalid, it MUST abort the connection with
  the appropriate alert.

- If the server requests a client certificate, the client MUST respond with an
  empty Certificate message, denoting no client certificate.

Note that authenticating a connection for the public name does not authenticate
it for the origin. The TLS implementation MUST NOT report such connections as
successful to the application. It additionally MUST ignore all session tickets
and session IDs presented by the server. These connections are only used to
trigger retries, as described in {{handle-server-response}}. This may be
implemented, for instance, by reporting a failed connection with a dedicated
error code.

### HelloRetryRequest {#hrr}

If the server sends a HelloRetryRequest in response to the ClientHello, the
client sends a second updated ClientHello per the rules in {{RFC8446}}.
However, at this point, the client does not know whether the server processed
ClientHelloOuter or ClientHelloInner, and MUST regenerate both values to be
acceptable. Note: if the inner and outer ClientHellos use different groups for
their key shares or differ in some other way, then the HelloRetryRequest may
actually be invalid for one or the other ClientHello, in which case a fresh
ClientHello MUST be generated, ignoring the instructions in HelloRetryRequest.
Otherwise, the usual rules for HelloRetryRequest processing apply.

Clients bind encryption of the second ClientHelloInner to encryption of the
first ClientHelloInner via the derived ech_hrr_key by modifying HPKE setup as
follows:

~~~
    pkR = Deserialize(ECHConfig.public_key)
    enc, context = SetupPSKS(
        pkR, "tls13 ech hrr", ech_hrr_key, "hrr key")
~~~

Clients then encrypt the second ClientHelloInner using this new HPKE context.
In doing so, the encrypted value is also authenticated by ech_hrr_key. The
rationale for this is described in {{flow-hrr-hijack}}.

Client-facing servers perform the corresponding process when decrypting second
ClientHelloInner messages. In particular, upon receipt of a second ClientHello
message with a ClientECH value, servers set up their HPKE context and
decrypt ClientECH as follows:

~~~
    context = SetupPSKR(ClientECH.enc,
        skR, "tls13 ech hrr", ech_hrr_key, "hrr key")
    ClientHelloInner = context.Open("", ClientECH.payload)
~~~

If the client offered ECH in the first ClientHello, then it MUST offer ECH in
the second. Likewise, if the client did not offer ECH in the first ClientHello,
then it MUST NOT not offer ECH in the second.

[[OPEN ISSUE: Should we be using the PSK input or the info input?  On the one
hand, the requirements on info seem weaker, but maybe actually this needs to be
secret? Analysis needed.]]

## GREASE extensions {#grease-extensions}

If the client attempts to connect to a server and does not have an ECHConfig
structure available for the server, it SHOULD send a GREASE {{?RFC8701}}
"encrypted_client_hello" extension as follows:

- Set the "suite" field  to a supported ECHCipherSuite. The selection SHOULD
  vary to exercise all supported configurations, but MAY be held constant for
  successive connections to the same server in the same session.

- Set the "config_id" field to a randomly-generated string of `Nh` bytes,
  where `Nh` is the output length of the `Extract` function of the KDF
  associated with the chosen cipher suite. (The KDF API is specified in
  {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}.)

- Set the "enc" field to a randomly-generated valid encapsulated public key
  output by the HPKE KEM.

- Set the "payload" field to a randomly-generated string of L+C bytes, where C
  is the ciphertext expansion of selected AEAD scheme and L is the size of the
  ClientHelloInner message the client would use given an ECHConfig structure,
  padded according to {{padding}}.

If the server sends an "encrypted_client_hello" extension, the client MUST check
the extension syntactically and abort the connection with a "decode_error" alert
if it is invalid.

Offering a GREASE extension is not considered offering an encrypted ClientHello
for purposes of requirements in {{client-behavior}}. In particular, the client
MAY offer to resume sessions established without ECH.

# Server Behavior {#server-behavior}

## Client-Facing Server

Upon receiving an "encrypted_client_hello" extension, the client-facing server
first checks that it is able to negotiate TLS 1.3 or higher. If not, then it
MUST ignore the extension and proceed with the handshake as usual. Next, the
server checks that the ClientHello contains a "server_name" extension and that
the indicated name is the public name of at least one of its ECH configurations.
If not, then the server MUST ignore the "encrypted_client_hello" extension and
proceed as usual. (Presumably the extension was generated as specified in
{{grease-extensions}} and not intended as a real ECH offer.) Otherwise, the
extension is handled by the client-facing server as follows.

The ClientECH value is said to match a known ECHConfig if there exists
an ECHConfig that can be used to successfully decrypt
ClientECH.payload. This matching procedure should be done using
one of the following two checks:

1. Compare ClientECH.config_id against identifiers of known ECH configurations
   and choose the first one that matches.
1. Use trial decryption of ClientECH.payload with known ECH configurations and
   choose the first one that succeeds.

Some uses of ECH, such as local discovery mode, may omit the ClientECH.config_id
since it can be used as a tracking vector. In such cases, trial decryption
should be used to select the ECH configuration. Unless specified by the
application using (D)TLS or externally configured on both sides, implementations
MUST use the first method.

If the ClientECH value does not match any known ECHConfig structure, it
MUST ignore the extension and proceed with the connection, with the following
added behavior:

- It MUST include the "encrypted_client_hello" extension in its
  EncryptedExtensions with the "retry_configs" field set to one or more
  ECHConfig structures with up-to-date keys. Servers MAY supply multiple
  ECHConfig values of different versions. This allows a server to support
  multiple versions at once.

- If offered, the server MUST ignore the "pre_shared_key" extension in the
  ClientHello.

Note that an unrecognized ClientECH.config_id value may be a GREASE ECH
extension (see {{grease-extensions}}), so it is necessary for servers to proceed
with the connection and rely on the client to abort if ECH was required. In
particular, the unrecognized value alone does not indicate a misconfigured ECH
advertisement ({{misconfiguration}}). Instead, servers can measure occurrences
of the "ech_required" alert to detect this case.

Once a suitable ECHConfig is found, the server verifies that the ECHConfig
supports the cipher suite indicated by ClientECH.cipher_suite and that the
version of ECH indicated by the client matches the ECHConfig.version. If not,
then the server MUST abort with an "illegal_parameter" alert. Otherwise, the
server decrypts ClientECH.payload, using the private key skR corresponding to
ECHConfig, as follows:

~~~
    context = SetupBaseR(ClientECH.enc, skR, "tls13 ech")
    ClientHelloInner = context.Open("", ClientECH.payload)
    ech_hrr_key = context.Export("tls13 ech hrr key", 16)
~~~

If decryption fails, the server MUST abort the connection with a "decrypt_error"
alert. Otherwise, the server scans ClientHelloInner for an "outer_extension"
extension and substitutes its value with the values in ClientHelloOuter and
validates the ClientHelloInner digest, as described in {{outer-extensions}}.

Upon determining the true SNI, the client-facing server then either serves the
connection directly (if in Shared Mode), in which case it executes the steps in
the following section, or forwards the TLS connection to the backend server (if
in Split Mode). In the latter case, it does not make any changes to the TLS
messages, but just blindly forwards them.

If the server sends a NewSessionTicket message, the corresponding ECH PSK MUST
be ignored by all other servers in the deployment when not negotiating ECH,
including servers which do not implement this specification.

### HelloRetryRequest

It is an error for the client to offer ECH before the HelloRetryRequest but not
after. Likewise, it is an error for the client to offer ECH after the
HelloRetryRequest but not before. If either of these conditions occurs, then the
client-facing server MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.

## Backend Server Behavior {#backend-server-behavior}

When the client-facing server accepts ECH, it forwards the ClientHelloInner to
the backend server, who terminates the connection. If the ClientHelloInner
contains an empty "encrypted_client_hello" extension, then the backend server
MUST confirm ECH acceptance by setting ServerHello.random[24:32] to

~~~~
    accept_confirmation = HKDF-Expand-Label(
        HKDF-Extract(0, ClientHelloInner.random),
        "ech accept confirmation",
        ServerHello.random[0:24], 8)
~~~~

where HKDF-Expand-Label and HKDF-Extract are as defined in {{RFC8446}}. The
value of ServerHello.random[0:24] is generated as usual by invoking a secure
random number generator (see {{RFC8446}}, Section 4.1.2).

# Compatibility Issues

Unlike most TLS extensions, placing the SNI value in an ECH extension is not
interoperable with existing servers, which expect the value in the existing
plaintext extension. Thus server operators SHOULD ensure servers understand a
given set of ECH keys before advertising them. Additionally, servers SHOULD
retain support for any previously-advertised keys for the duration of their
validity

However, in more complex deployment scenarios, this may be difficult to fully
guarantee. Thus this protocol was designed to be robust in case of
inconsistencies between systems that advertise ECH keys and servers, at the cost
of extra round-trips due to a retry. Two specific scenarios are detailed below.

## Misconfiguration and Deployment Concerns {#misconfiguration}

It is possible for ECH advertisements and servers to become inconsistent. This
may occur, for instance, from DNS misconfiguration, caching issues, or an
incomplete rollout in a multi-server deployment. This may also occur if a server
loses its ECH keys, or if a deployment of ECH must be rolled back on the server.

The retry mechanism repairs inconsistencies, provided the server is
authoritative for the public name. If server and advertised keys mismatch, the
server will respond with ech_retry_requested. If the server does not understand
the "encrypted_client_hello" extension at all, it will ignore it as required by
{{RFC8446}}; Section 4.1.2. Provided the server can present a certificate valid
for the public name, the client can safely retry with updated settings, as
described in {{handle-server-response}}.

Unless ECH is disabled as a result of successfully establishing a connection to
the public name, the client MUST NOT fall back to using unencrypted
ClientHellos, as this allows a network attacker to disclose the contents of this
ClientHello, including the SNI. It MAY attempt to use another server from the
DNS results, if one is provided.

## Middleboxes

A more serious problem is MITM proxies which do not support this extension.
{{RFC8446}}, Section 9.3 requires that such proxies remove any extensions they
do not understand. The handshake will then present a certificate based on the
public name, without echoing the "encrypted_client_hello" extension to the
client.

Depending on whether the client is configured to accept the proxy's certificate
as authoritative for the public name, this may trigger the retry logic described
in {{handle-server-response}} or result in a connection failure. A proxy which
is not authoritative for the public name cannot forge a signal to disable ECH.

A non-conformant MITM proxy which instead forwards the ECH extension,
substituting its own KeyShare value, will result in the client-facing server
recognizing the key, but failing to decrypt the SNI. This causes a hard failure.
Clients SHOULD NOT attempt to repair the connection in this case.

# Compliance Requirements {#compliance}

In the absence of an application profile standard specifying otherwise,
a compliant ECH application MUST implement the following HPKE cipher suite:

- KEM: DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256) (see {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}, Section 7.1)
- KDF: HKDF-SHA256 (see {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}, Section 7.2)
- AEAD: AES-128-GCM (see {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}, Section 7.3)

# Security Considerations

## Security and Privacy Goals {#goals}

ECH considers two types of attackers: passive and active. Passive attackers can
read packets from the network. They cannot perform any sort of active behavior
such as probing servers or querying DNS. A middlebox that filters based on
plaintext packet contents is one example of a passive attacker. In contrast,
active attackers can write packets into the network for malicious purposes, such
as interfering with existing connections, probing servers, and querying DNS. In
short, an active attacker corresponds to the conventional threat model for
TLS 1.3 {{RFC8446}}.

Given these types of attackers, the primary goals of ECH are as follows.

1. Use of ECH does not weaken the security properties of TLS without ECH.
1. TLS connection establishment to a host with a specific ECHConfig and TLS
   configuration is indistinguishable from a connection to any other host with
   the same ECHConfig and TLS configuration. (The set of hosts which share the
   same ECHConfig and TLS configuration is referred to as the anonymity set.)

Client-facing server configuration determines the size of the anonymity set. For
example, if a client-facing server uses distinct ECHConfig values for each host,
then each anonymity set has size k = 1. Client-facing servers SHOULD deploy ECH
in such a way so as to maximize the size of the anonymity set where possible.
This means client-facing servers should use the same ECHConfig for as many hosts
as possible. An attacker can distinguish two hosts that have different ECHConfig
values based on the ClientECH.config_id value. This also means public
information in a TLS handshake is also consistent across hosts. For example, if
a client-facing server services many backend origin hosts, only one of which
supports some cipher suite, it may be possible to identify that host based on
the contents of unencrypted handshake messages.

Beyond these primary security and privacy goals, ECH also aims to hide, to some
extent, (a) whether or not a specific server supports ECH and (b) whether or
not ECH was accepted for a particular connection. ECH aims to achieve both
properties, assuming the attacker is passive and does not know the set of ECH
configurations offered by the client-facing server. It does not achieve these
properties for active attackers. More specifically:

- Passive attackers with a known ECH configuration can distinguish between a
connection that negotiates ECH with that configuration and one which does not,
because the latter used a GREASE "encrypted_client_hello" extension (as
specified in {{grease-extensions}}) or a different ECH configuration.
- Passive attackers without the ECH configuration cannot distinguish between a
connection that negotiates ECH and one which uses a GREASE
"encrypted_client_hello" extension.
- Active attackers can distinguish between a connection that negotiates ECH and
one which uses a GREASE "encrypted_client_hello" extension.

See {{do-not-stick-out}} for more discussion about the "do not stick out"
criteria from {{?RFC8744}}.

## Unauthenticated and Plaintext DNS {#plaintext-dns}

In comparison to {{?I-D.kazuho-protected-sni}}, wherein DNS Resource Records are
signed via a server private key, ECH records have no authenticity or provenance
information. This means that any attacker which can inject DNS responses or
poison DNS caches, which is a common scenario in client access networks, can
supply clients with fake ECH records (so that the client encrypts data to them)
or strip the ECH record from the response. However, in the face of an attacker
that controls DNS, no encryption scheme can work because the attacker can
replace the IP address, thus blocking client connections, or substituting a
unique IP address which is 1:1 with the DNS name that was looked up (modulo DNS
wildcards). Thus, allowing the ECH records in the clear does not make the
situation significantly worse.

Clearly, DNSSEC (if the client validates and hard fails) is a defense against
this form of attack, but DoH/DPRIVE are also defenses against DNS attacks by
attackers on the local network, which is a common case where ClientHello and SNI
encryption are desired. Moreover, as noted in the introduction, SNI encryption
is less useful without encryption of DNS queries in transit via DoH or DPRIVE
mechanisms.

## Client Tracking

A malicious client-facing server could distribute unique, per-client ECHConfig
structures as a way of tracking clients across subsequent connections. On-path
adversaries which know about these unique keys could also track clients in this
way by observing TLS connection attempts.

The cost of this type of attack scales linearly with the desired number of
target clients. Moreover, DNS caching behavior makes targeting individual users
for extended periods of time, e.g., using per-client ECHConfig structures
delivered via HTTPS RRs with high TTLs, challenging. Clients can help mitigate
this problem by flushing any DNS or ECHConfig state upon changing networks.

## Optional Configuration Identifiers and Trial Decryption {#optional-configs}

Optional configuration identifiers may be useful in scenarios where clients and
client-facing servers do not want to reveal information about the client-facing
server in the "encrypted_client_hello" extension. In such settings, clients send
either an empty config_id or a randomly generated config_id in the ClientECH.
(The precise implementation choice for this mechanism is out of scope for this
document.) Servers in these settings must perform trial decryption since they
cannot identify the client's chosen ECH key using the config_id value. As a
result, support for optional configuration identifiers may exacerbate DoS
attacks. Specifically, an adversary may send malicious ClientHello messages,
i.e., those which will not decrypt with any known ECH key, in order to force
wasteful decryption. Servers that support this feature should, for example,
implement some form of rate limiting mechanism to limit the damage caused by
such attacks.

## Outer ClientHello

Any information that the client includes in the ClientHelloOuter is visible to
passive observers. The client SHOULD NOT send values in the ClientHelloOuter
which would reveal a sensitive ClientHelloInner property, such as the true
server name. It MAY send values associated with the public name in the
ClientHelloOuter.

In particular, some extensions require the client send a server-name-specific
value in the ClientHello. These values may reveal information about the
true server name. For example, the "cached_info" ClientHello extension
{{?RFC7924}} can contain the hash of a previously observed server certificate.
The client SHOULD NOT send values associated with the true server name in the
ClientHelloOuter. It MAY send such values in the ClientHelloInner.

Values which are independent of the true server name, or other information the
client wishes to protect, MAY be included in ClientHelloOuter and compressed as
described in {{outer-extensions}}.

## Related Privacy Leaks

ECH requires encrypted DNS to be an effective privacy protection mechanism.
However, verifying the server's identity from the Certificate message,
particularly when using the X509 CertificateType, may result in additional
network traffic that may reveal the server identity. Examples of this traffic
may include requests for revocation information, such as OCSP or CRL traffic, or
requests for repository information, such as authorityInformationAccess. It may
also include implementation-specific traffic for additional information sources
as part of verification.

Implementations SHOULD avoid leaking information that may identify the server.
Even when sent over an encrypted transport, such requests may result in indirect
exposure of the server's identity, such as indicating a specific CA or service
being used. To mitigate this risk, servers SHOULD deliver such information
in-band when possible, such as through the use of OCSP stapling, and clients
SHOULD take steps to minimize or protect such requests during certificate
validation.

## Attacks Exploiting Acceptance Confirmation

To signal acceptance, the backend server overwrites 8 bytes of its
ServerHello.random with a value derived from the ClientHelloInner.random. (See
{{backend-server-behavior}} for details.) This behavior increases the likelihood
of the ServerHello.random colliding with the ServerHello.random of a previous
session, potentially reducing the overall security of the protocol. However, the
remaining 24 bytes provide enough entropy to ensure this is not a practical
avenue of attack.

On the other hand, the probability that two 8-byte strings are the same is
non-negligible. This poses a modest operational risk. Suppose the client-facing
server terminates the connection (i.e., ECH is rejected or bypassed): if the
last 8 bytes of its ServerHello.random coincide with the confirmation signal,
then the client will incorrectly presume acceptance and proceed as if the
backend server terminated the connection. However, the probability of a false
positive occurring for a given connection is only 1 in 2^64.

Note that the same bytes of the ServerHello.random are used to implement
downgrade protection for TLS 1.3 (see {{RFC8446}}, Section 4.1.3). The backend
server's signal of acceptance does not interfere with this mechanism because ECH
is only supported in TLS 1.3 or higher.

## Comparison Against Criteria

{{?RFC8744}} lists several requirements for SNI encryption.
In this section, we re-iterate these requirements and assess the ECH design
against them.

### Mitigate against replay attacks

Since servers process either ClientHelloInner or ClientHelloOuter, and because
ClientHelloInner.random is encrypted, it is not possible for an attacker to "cut
and paste" the ECH value in a different Client Hello and learn information from
ClientHelloInner.

### Avoid widely-deployed shared secrets

This design depends upon DNS as a vehicle for semi-static public key
distribution. Server operators may partition their private keys however they
see fit provided each server behind an IP address has the corresponding private
key to decrypt a key. Thus, when one ECH key is provided, sharing is optimally
bound by the number of hosts that share an IP address. Server operators may
further limit sharing by publishing different DNS records containing ECHConfig
values with different keys using a short TTL.

### Prevent SNI-based DoS attacks

This design requires servers to decrypt ClientHello messages with ClientECH
extensions carrying valid digests. Thus, it is possible for an attacker to force
decryption operations on the server. This attack is bound by the number of valid
TCP connections an attacker can open.

### Do not stick out {#do-not-stick-out}

The only explicit signal indicating possible use of ECH is the ClientHello
"encrypted_client_hello" extension. Server handshake messages do not contain any
signal indicating use or negotiation of ECH. Clients MAY GREASE the
"encrypted_client_hello" extension, as described in {{grease-extensions}}, which
helps ensure the ecosystem handles ECH correctly. Moreover, as more clients
enable ECH support, e.g., as normal part of Web browser functionality, with keys
supplied by shared hosting providers, the presence of ECH extensions becomes
less unusual and part of typical client behavior. In other words, if all Web
browsers start using ECH, the presence of this value will not signal unusual
behavior to passive eavesdroppers.

### Forward secrecy

This design is not forward secret because the server's ECH key is static.
However, the window of exposure is bound by the key lifetime. It is RECOMMENDED
that servers rotate keys frequently.

### Proper security context

This design permits servers operating in Split Mode to forward connections
directly to backend origin servers, thereby avoiding unnecessary MiTM attacks.

### Split server spoofing

Assuming ECH records retrieved from DNS are authenticated, e.g., via DNSSEC or
fetched from a trusted Recursive Resolver, spoofing a server operating in Split
Mode is not possible. See {{plaintext-dns}} for more details regarding plaintext
DNS.

Authenticating the ECHConfigs structure naturally authenticates the included
public name. This also authenticates any retry signals from the server because
the client validates the server certificate against the public name before
retrying.

### Supporting multiple protocols

This design has no impact on application layer protocol negotiation. It may
affect connection routing, server certificate selection, and client certificate
verification. Thus, it is compatible with multiple protocols.

## Padding Policy

Variations in the length of the ClientHelloInner ciphertext could leak
information about the corresponding plaintext. {{padding}} describes a
RECOMMENDED padding mechanism for clients aimed at reducing potential
information leakage.

## Active Attack Mitigations

This section describes the rationale for ECH properties and mechanics as
defenses against active attacks. In all the attacks below, the attacker is
on-path between the target client and server. The goal of the attacker is to
learn private information about the inner ClientHello, such as the true SNI
value.

### Client Reaction Attack Mitigation {#flow-client-reaction}

This attack uses the client's reaction to an incorrect certificate as an oracle.
The attacker intercepts a legitimate ClientHello and replies with a ServerHello,
Certificate, CertificateVerify, and Finished messages, wherein the Certificate
message contains a "test" certificate for the domain name it wishes to query. If
the client decrypted the Certificate and failed verification (or leaked
information about its verification process by a timing side channel), the
attacker learns that its test certificate name was incorrect. As an example,
suppose the client's SNI value in its inner ClientHello is "example.com," and
the attacker replied with a Certificate for "test.com". If the client produces a
verification failure alert because of the mismatch faster than it would due to
the Certificate signature validation, information about the name leaks. Note
that the attacker can also withhold the CertificateVerify message. In that
scenario, a client which first verifies the Certificate would then respond
similarly and leak the same information.

~~~
{: #flow-diagram-client-reaction title="Client reaction attack"}

ClientHelloInner.random prevents this attack. In particular, since the attacker
does not have access to this value, it cannot produce the right transcript and
handshake keys needed for encrypting the Certificate message. Thus, the client
will fail to decrypt the Certificate and abort the connection.

### HelloRetryRequest Hijack Mitigation {#flow-hrr-hijack}

This attack aims to exploit server HRR state management to recover information
about a legitimate ClientHello using its own attacker-controlled ClientHello.
To begin, the attacker intercepts and forwards a legitimate ClientHello with an
"encrypted_client_hello" (ech) extension to the server, which triggers a
legitimate HelloRetryRequest in return. Rather than forward the retry to the
client, the attacker, attempts to generate its own ClientHello in response based
on the contents of the first ClientHello and HelloRetryRequest exchange with the
result that the server encrypts the Certificate to the attacker. If the server
used the SNI from the first ClientHello and the key share from the second
(attacker-controlled) ClientHello, the Certificate produced would leak the
client's chosen SNI to the attacker.

~~~
{: #flow-diagram-hrr-hijack title="HelloRetryRequest hijack attack"}

This attack is mitigated by binding the first and second ClientHello messages
together. In particular, since the attacker does not possess the ech_hrr_key, it
cannot generate a valid encryption of the second inner ClientHello. The server
will attempt decryption using ech_hrr_key, detect failure, and fail the
connection.

If the second ClientHello were not bound to the first, it might be possible for
the server to act as an oracle if it required parameters from the first
ClientHello to match that of the second ClientHello. For example, imagine the
client's original SNI value in the inner ClientHello is "example.com", and the
attacker's hijacked SNI value in its inner ClientHello is "test.com". A server
which checks these for equality and changes behavior based on the result can be
used as an oracle to learn the client's SNI.

### Resumption PSK Oracle Mitigation {#flow-resumption-oracle}

This attack uses resumption PSKs as an oracle for dictionary attacks against a
given ClientHello's true SNI. To begin, the attacker first interacts with a
server to obtain a resumption ticket for a given test domain, such as
"test.com". Later, upon receipt of a legitimate ClientHello without a PSK
binder, it computes a PSK binder using its own ticket and forwards the resulting
ClientHello. Assume the server then validates the PSK binder on the outer
ClientHello and chooses connection parameters based on the inner ClientHello. A
server which then validates information in the outer ClientHello ticket against
information in the inner ClientHello, such as the SNI, introduces an oracle that
can be used to test the encrypted SNI value of specific ClientHello messages.

ECH mitigates against this attack by requiring servers not mix-and-match
information from the inner and outer ClientHello. For example, if the server
accepts the inner ClientHello, it does not validate binders in the outer
ClientHello. This means that ECH PSKs are used within the HPKE encryption
envelope.

# IANA Considerations

## Update of the TLS ExtensionType Registry

IANA is requested to create the following two entries in the existing registry
for ExtensionType (defined in {{!RFC8446}}):

1. encrypted_client_hello(0xff08), with "TLS 1.3" column values being set to
   "CH, EE", and "Recommended" column being set to "Yes".
3. outer_extension(0xff04), with the "TLS 1.3" column values being set to "CH",
   and "Recommended" column being set to "Yes".

## Update of the TLS Alert Registry {#alerts}

IANA is requested to create an entry, ech_required(121) in the existing registry
for Alerts (defined in {{!RFC8446}}), with the "DTLS-OK" column being set to
"Y".

# ECHConfig Extension Guidance {#config-extensions-guidance}

Any future information or hints that influence the outer ClientHello SHOULD be
specified as ECHConfig extensions. This is primarily because the outer
ClientHello exists only in support of ECH. Namely, it is both an envelope for
the encrypted inner ClientHello and enabler for authenticated key mismatch
signals (see {{server-behavior}}). In contrast, the inner ClientHello is the
true ClientHello used upon ECH negotiation.

# Alternative SNI Protection Designs

Alternative approaches to encrypted SNI may be implemented at the TLS or
application layer. In this section we describe several alternatives and discuss
drawbacks in comparison to the design in this document.

## TLS-layer

### TLS in Early Data

In this variant, TLS Client Hellos are tunneled within early data payloads
belonging to outer TLS connections established with the client-facing server.
This requires clients to have established a previous session -— and obtained
PSKs —- with the server. The client-facing server decrypts early data payloads
to uncover Client Hellos destined for the backend server, and forwards them
onwards as necessary. Afterwards, all records to and from backend servers are
forwarded by the client-facing server -- unmodified. This avoids double
encryption of TLS records.

Problems with this approach are: (1) servers may not always be able to
distinguish inner Client Hellos from legitimate application data, (2) nested
0-RTT data may not function correctly, (3) 0-RTT data may not be supported --
especially under DoS -- leading to availability concerns, and (4) clients must
bootstrap tunnels (sessions), costing an additional round trip and potentially
revealing the SNI during the initial connection. In contrast, encrypted SNI
protects the SNI in a distinct Client Hello extension and neither abuses early
data nor requires a bootstrapping connection.

### Combined Tickets

In this variant, client-facing and backend servers coordinate to produce
"combined tickets" that are consumable by both. Clients offer combined tickets
to client-facing servers. The latter parse them to determine the correct backend
server to which the Client Hello should be forwarded. This approach is
problematic due to non-trivial coordination between client-facing and backend
servers for ticket construction and consumption. Moreover, it requires a
bootstrapping step similar to that of the previous variant. In contrast,
encrypted SNI requires no such coordination.

## Application-layer

### HTTP/2 CERTIFICATE Frames

In this variant, clients request secondary certificates with CERTIFICATE_REQUEST
HTTP/2 frames after TLS connection completion. In response, servers supply
certificates via TLS exported authenticators
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-exported-authenticator}} in CERTIFICATE frames. Clients use a
generic SNI for the underlying client-facing server TLS connection. Problems
with this approach include: (1) one additional round trip before peer
authentication, (2) non-trivial application-layer dependencies and interaction,
and (3) obtaining the generic SNI to bootstrap the connection. In contrast,
encrypted SNI induces no additional round trip and operates below the
application layer.

# Acknowledgements

This document draws extensively from ideas in {{?I-D.kazuho-protected-sni}}, but
is a much more limited mechanism because it depends on the DNS for the
protection of the ECH key. Richard Barnes, Christian Huitema, Patrick McManus,
Matthew Prince, Nick Sullivan, Martin Thomson, and David Benjamin also provided
important ideas and contributions.
